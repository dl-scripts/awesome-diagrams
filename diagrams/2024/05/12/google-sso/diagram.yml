  Cloud Identity and Google Workspace support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 for single sign-on. SAML is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between a SAML IdP and SAML service providers. When you use SSO for Cloud Identity or Google Workspace, your external IdP is the SAML IdP and Google is the SAML service provider.
