  ActiveMQ sends messages between client applications—producers, which create messages and submit them for delivery, and consumers, which receive and process messages. The ActiveMQ broker routes each message through a messaging endpoint called a destination (in ActiveMQ Classic) or an address (in Artemis). Both ActiveMQ versions are capable of point-to-point messaging—in which the broker routes each message to one of the available consumers in a round-robin pattern—and publish/subscribe (or “pub/sub”) messaging—in which the broker delivers each message to every consumer that is subscribed to the topic (in ActiveMQ Classic) or address (in ActiveMQ Artemis).
