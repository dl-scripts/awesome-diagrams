  Overview of ArtPrompt. ArtPrompt consists of two steps. In the first step,
  ArtPrompt masks the safety words (e.g., â€œbomb") within a prompt that could
  result in rejection from the victim LLM. In the second step, ArtPrompt
  replaces the masked word in Step I with ASCII art. Then the masked prompt is
  combined with the ASCII art representation to form a cloaked prompt. The
  cloaked prompt is finally sent to the victim LLM as a jailbreak attack.
