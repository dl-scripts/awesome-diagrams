  The dbt Cloud application has two types of components: static and dynamic. The static components are always running to serve highly available dbt Cloud functions, like the dbt Cloud web application. On the other hand, the dynamic components are created ad-hoc to handle tasks such as background jobs or requests to use the IDE.
