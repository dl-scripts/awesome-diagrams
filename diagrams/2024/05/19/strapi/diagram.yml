description: Strapi's architecture is decomposed into several independent but interconnected services. At its core, Strapi is built on a modern JavaScript stack, leveraging Node.js, Koa, and React, among other technologies. It also operates on a modular architecture that houses various registries, a dynamic plugin system, and an extensible API framework.
