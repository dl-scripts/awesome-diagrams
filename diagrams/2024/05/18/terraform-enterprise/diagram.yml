  Terraform Enterprise can be installed and function in different implementation modes with increasing capability and complexity

  Standalone - The base architecture with a single application node that supports the standard implementation requirements for the platform.
  Active/Active - This is an extension of Standalone mode that adds multiple active node capability that can expand horizontally to support larger and increasing execution loads.
