  In a RabbitMQ cluster, there can be two type of nodes,memory node and disk
  node. There is at least one disk nodein the cluster, on which conﬁguration
  information and meta-information are stored. It should be noted that
  RabbitMQ’sarchitecture has poor scalability due to the complete replica-tion
  design.
