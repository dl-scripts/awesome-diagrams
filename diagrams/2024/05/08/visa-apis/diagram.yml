  Visa Developer Platform helps consolidate multiple partner and developer facing assets across Visa into a common platform to simplify partner connectivity. Visa’s API management features can help accelerate the pace of collaboration and innovation within Visa and between its strategic partner, by providing them with a one stop shop for API availability. The API management platform becomes an API “portal” where developers across the B2B/B2C space can efficiently leverage Visa APIs.
