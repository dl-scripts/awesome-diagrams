  An Istio service mesh is logically split into a data plane and a control plane.

  The data plane is composed of a set of intelligent proxies (Envoy) deployed as sidecars. These proxies mediate and control all network communication between microservices. They also collect and report telemetry on all mesh traffic.

  The control plane manages and configures the proxies to route traffic.
